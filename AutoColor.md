## Auto Color

Enabling this switch in the settings provides auto coloring of tracks. In the settings of the script you can set a search string for each color. E.g. if you write "Bass" after the color red, all tracks, which contain the word "Bass" in their name will automatically be colored in red. For multiple search strings use a comma, e.g. I put "Drum,BD,Snare,HiHat,Crash" after blue to auto color all drum related tracks.
