# Installation

Get the latest stable release from [my homepage](http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/Bitwig/Bitwig.html).

> **The version in GitHub might always be in an alpha or beta state, you have been warned!**

## Basic installation

1. Extract the ZIP file. It contains a file named **DrivenByMoss.bwextension**.
2. Copy that file in the following location depending on your OS:
   * Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Bitwig Studio\Extensions\`
   * Mac: `~/Documents/Bitwig Studio/Extensions/`
   * Linux:   `~/Bitwig Studio/Extensions/`
3. Start Bitwig Studio and open the *Dashboard*. Select *Settings* and *Controllers*.
4. If **Autdetect** is enabled for most of the controllers you automatically get a popup notification.
5. Alternatively, select **Add controller manually**. In that case note that the extension does not start 
   until you configured the necessary in- and outputs!

See the documentation of the individual controllers for further installation/configuration instructions.
