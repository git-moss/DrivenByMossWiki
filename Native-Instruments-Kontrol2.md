# Bitwig Studio | Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol 2 S49, S61, S88, Komplete Kontrol A49, A61, M32

Support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol controller Version 2.

Since the extension requires the Native Instruments Host Integration service it **only works on Windows and Mac (no Linux)**.

The basic feature set is identical to Ableton Live as described in the Kontrol manual.
Additionally, there are some settings to change the behaviour.

The S-series has an additional device/parameters mode. Toggle this mode with the CLEAR button.

* The screens display 8 parameters
* The volume and pan display represents the value of each parameter
* The knobs below changes the parameter values (both in volume and pan mode)
* The bank left/right buttons switch between the devices of the channel
* The encoder up/down switches between the devices of the channel as well
* The encoder left/right switches between the parameter pages of the selected device
* Pressing the encoder toggles the window of the selected device (if any)
* Mute/Solo buttons always controls the tracks
