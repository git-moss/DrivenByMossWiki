# Bitwig Studio | Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol 2 S49, S61

Support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol controller Version 2.

The feature set is identical to Ableton Live as described in the Kontrol manual.

Since the extension requires the Native Instruments Host Integration service it **only works on Windows and Mac (no Linux)**.
