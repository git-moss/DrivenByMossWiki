# Bitwig Studio | Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol 2 S49, S61, S88, Komplete Kontrol A49, A61, M32

Support for Native Instruments Komplete Kontrol controllers, which use the NI Host Integration protocol.
Since Native Instruments Host Integration service is only available for Windows and Macos,  **Linux is not supported**.

## Installation

Native Instruments Host Integration service must be installed and running. It is automatically the case
if you installed Komplete Kontrol on your machine.

1. Select the MIDI input and output ending with "DAW" as the first channel.
2. Select the MIDI input and output without an ending as the second.

## Features

The basic feature set is identical to Ableton Live as described in the respective Kontrol manuals.
Additionally, there are some settings to change the behaviour.
