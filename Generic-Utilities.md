# Bitwig Studio | Generic Utilities

Several utilities for Bitwig.

## Auto Color

Enabling this switch in the settings provides auto coloring of tracks. In the settings of the script you can set a search string for each color. E.g. if you write "Bass" after the color red, all tracks, which contain the word "Bass" in their name will automatically be colored in red. For multiple search strings use a comma, e.g. I put "Drum,BD,Snare,HiHat,Crash" after blue to auto color all drum related tracks.

## Tempo control

Enabling this switch in the settings scans the names of scenes for tempo information. If you start such a scene the tempo is automatically set. E.g. if you set the name of a scene to "My Song 127BPM", the tempo will be set to 127 bpm when you start the scene. "BPM" can be written in upper or lower case. You can leave spaces between the numbers and "bpm".
